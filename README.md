# Mapping-pandemic
Abrupt pandemics have been causing greatest time to time loss to citizens and countries. Imagine if christmas would occuring abrupt, seller would not prepare to sell christmas trees and other christmas dependencies thus would fall to loss and few who are accessible to them goods would get profit.

The same case if to the countries who are aware of pandemics outbreak and prepared to act to such situations. We use machine learning, artificial intelligence and explainable AI to help countries and health institutions to get prepared with such situations.

We we made a web app that gives preliminary diagnosis to predict that someone is unfortunate a victim of ebola pandemic, he or she fills a form and in the backends a model that is trained from past experience predicts is such person is in which condition.
